# Greyscale-Gaussian-blur---Colour-image-processing
an application that can apply a sequential or parallel greyscale gaussian blue, additionally it has a colour image processor which removes overlapping pixels that does not belong and can turn it into a black and white image

This was created as a testbed to be ran on varying machines to show the difference in speed between sequential and parallel programming.
